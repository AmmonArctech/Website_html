        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am 22 years old and I got married to my gorgeous bride this last summer. She is the greatest motivation with the sweetest heart. 
          I would be nuts not to mention her in this, because she is the reason why I am here still pushing forward in the CS major today, and enjoying it! 
          I am a Software Engineering major, and the reason I got into that is because I really like business and coming up with ideas. 
          You are probably thinking, “why didn't this kid go into business then”, and the answer is because I wanted a hard skill to be 
          able to push my ideas forward. I saw Software. Engineering as one of the most powerful skills I could procure, due to the fact 
          that if I can think of a way to do it electronically, I can make anything I want to. An example of this is this class. I have 
          been having this idea to connect landscapers and customers, but I haven't had the skills to do that until this class. This class 
          and what I learn in this class helps me achieve that goal on a small degree and I can build it from there.

          I am also interning at a battery care company that is named Arctech Charge. I am on the programming team where we have been 
          looking into optimizing battery life and charge time. The coolest part is, that I have been able to start learning things that 
          I don’t think I would have had the opportunity learning in any other job. I have been able to learn how to code hardware, and 
          especially these single board computers which I think is so cool that they can fit so much on such a little space. I have been 
          able to relate that to my classes and I have found more of a vested interest in all of my CS classes. I also want to get more 
          involved with mini startups that I can contribute to, and also continue to have some of my other ideas come to fruition.

        <h2>Start up project</h2>
        <img src="GreenConnect Logo.png"/>
        <p>
          Before my mission I started a landscaping business and we did fairly well, but there definitely was room for improvement on 
          both communication and managing. Ever since starting my CS degree, I have been interested in finding out a way that I could 
          better link the two, and this class is actually helping me put a step forward in that direction! The startup is a website where 
          Landscapers and customers connect. On one side, the Landscaper will have appointments and a quick customer profile check. The 
          customer has the calendar to schedule and request visits, but also be able to communicate more fully with the landscapers 
          on what they are wanting to be focused in their yard.

        <h2>Simon project</h2>
        <p>
          Simon is a memorization game, and we have been able to start building our versions of it. Even though we are not creating 
          I thought that I would change a few things, like the tabs. I think horizontal tabs just look so much better, so they have 
          the same functionality and the entire game has the same functionality but I think just that top bar looks so much better!
